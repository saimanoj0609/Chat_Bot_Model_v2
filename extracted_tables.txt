path is the location on the ftp server where firmimgFIT.d9 is stored.
racadm fwupdate -r
racadm fwupdate -p -u [-d <path>]
NOTE: When attempting to run firmware update task, if the firmware image path length is greater than
256 characters, remote RACADM client exits with the error message "ERROR: Specified path
is too long".
Input	● —u—The update option performs a checksum of the firmware update file and starts the update
process. This option may be used along with the —g or —p options. At the end of the update, iDRAC
performs a soft reset.
● —s—This option returns the status of the update process.
● -a—The -a option specifies TFTP server IP address that is used for firmware image. This option must
be used with the -g option.
● --clearcfg—The -clearcfg option removes the previous iDRAC configuration after firmware
update.
● -g—The get option instructs the firmware to get the firmware update file from the TFTP server.
Specify the -a -u, and —d options. In the absence of the —a option, the defaults are read from
properties in the group cfgRemoteHosts, using properties cfgRhostsFwUpdateIpAddr and
cfgRhostsFwUpdatePath.
● -p—The -p, or put, option is used to update the firmware file from the managed system to iDRAC. The
-u option must be used with the -p option.
● Default: Designated TFTP default directory on that host for the file if -g option is absent. If -g is
used, it defaults to a directory configured on the TFTP server.
NOTE: The -p option is supported on local and remote RACADM and is not supported with the
serial/ssh console and on the Linux operating systems.
NOTE: The -p option is applicable for both remote and local RACADM proxy commands. However, this
option is not supported for local RACADM running on Linux operating systems.
NOTE: The filename for firmware update file must be firmimgFIT.d9.
● -r—The rollback option is used to roll back to the standby firmware.
Output	Displays a message indicating the operation that is being performed.

Page 44 Tables:
fwupdate	None
	● Query the current status of the firmware update process:
racadm fwupdate -s
● Rollback to the standby firmware:
racadm fwupdate -r
● Upload firmware image from TFTP server, start firmware update. After firmware update is complete,
delete previous iDRAC configuration:
racadm fwupdate -g -u -a 192.168.0.100 -d /tmp/images --clearcfg
NOTE: Firmware update from local RACADM (using -p -u -d options) is not supported on Linux
operating system.

● To perform a cryptographic erase operation on PCIeSSD device, run the following command:
racadm storage cryptographicerase:<PCIeSSD FQDD>
● To perform a cryptographic erase operation on PCIeSSD device using PSID, run the following command:
racadm storage cryptographicerase:<SED FQDD> -psid <PSID>
● To set the encryption mode to Secure Enterprise Key Manager (SEKM) for the PERC controller or
migrate from Local Key Manager (LKM) to SEKM mode:
racadm storage setencryptionmode:<Controller FQDD> -mode <KEY
Management Mode> -passphrase <Dell@123>
NOTE: Ensure that you enable SEKM on iDRAC before enabling SEKM on the PERC controller or
while migrating the PERC controller from LKM to SEKM security mode.
● To request iDRAC to rekey all devices:
racadm storage rekey:<Controller FQDD>
● To export the storage controller identity certificate to a CIFS or NFS share, run the following command:
NOTE: This command supports both IPV4 and IPV6 formats. IPV6 is applicable for CIFS and NFS
type remote shares.
NOTE: This feature is only supported on storage controllers which support SPDM (Example: PERC
12).
racadm storage exportcertificate:<FQDD> -l <CIFS or NFS share> -u
<username> -p <password> -f <filename> -t <identity>
Input	● -o—Specifies the optimized version.

Description	Allows you to perform supportassist operations such as:
● collect : Collects the supportassist data and exports to local share, or remote share, or Dell site
depending on the parameters given in the command. You can specify the type of the logs to be in the
collect command. To run this command, user must accept the End User License Agreement (EULA).
NOTE: When performing the collect operation on chassis system, ensure that you use the -t
Debug option.
● register : Allows registration of supportassist to enable related features.
● exportlastcollection : Exports the last collected supportassist data to the share which is
mentioned in the command or to the default share. Default share can be configured using the
supportassist attributes.

○ vflash—To erase vFlash.
○ nvdimm—To erase all NonVolatileMemory.
NOTE: When BIOS is selected for System Erase, the server is turned off and the iDRAC is reset at
the end of the Automated Task Application. To complete the process of BIOS reset, the server power
must be restored. When the server is turned on, during POST, the BIOS completes the process of
resetting to the default properties. At the completion of the reset process, the server is again turned
off. Resetting the BIOS also includes the erasing of BIOS-related nonvolatile settings that are used by
the OS and embedded in the UEFI applications.
NOTE: When the racadm systemerase command is executed, the iDRAC will take the following actions
if the:
● Server is powered off—it is powered on.
● Server is powered on—a graceful system reboot will be executed.
● ACPI is enabled on the server— a graceful shutdown occurs within a minute or two.
● ACPI is not enabled—a forced shutdown occurs and it may require up to ten minutes to complete.
Following the server reboot, the Lifecycle Controller will execute the System Erase job to carry out
the requested actions. All actions performed by the System Erase operations are recorded to the
Lifecycle Log, including details of all devices erased. When these actions are completed, the server will
be powered off and remain in this state, allowing service personnel to perform any needed posterase
actions such as drive removal or hardware reconfiguration. When the server is powered on to return to
service, the Lifecycle Controller will collect the system inventory and reflect any hardware or firmware
changes made after the System Erase.
