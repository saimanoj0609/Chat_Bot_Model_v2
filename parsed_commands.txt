Input	● —u—The update option performs a checksum of the firmware update file and starts the update
process. This option may be used along with the —g or —p options. At the end of the update, iDRAC
performs a soft reset.
● —s—This option returns the status of the update process.
● -a—The -a option specifies TFTP server IP address that is used for firmware image. This option must
be used with the -g option.
● --clearcfg—The -clearcfg option removes the previous iDRAC configuration after firmware
update.
● -g—The get option instructs the firmware to get the firmware update file from the TFTP server.
Specify the -a -u, and —d options. In the absence of the —a option, the defaults are read from
properties in the group cfgRemoteHosts, using properties cfgRhostsFwUpdateIpAddr and
cfgRhostsFwUpdatePath.
● -p—The -p, or put, option is used to update the firmware file from the managed system to iDRAC. The
-u option must be used with the -p option.
● Default: Designated TFTP default directory on that host for the file if -g option is absent. If -g is
used, it defaults to a directory configured on the TFTP server.
NOTE: The -p option is supported on local and remote RACADM and is not supported with the
serial/ssh console and on the Linux operating systems.
NOTE: The -p option is applicable for both remote and local RACADM proxy commands. However, this
option is not supported for local RACADM running on Linux operating systems.
NOTE: The filename for firmware update file must be firmimgFIT.d9.
● -r—The rollback option is used to roll back to the standby firmware.
Output	Displays a message indicating the operation that is being performed.

● Query the current status of the firmware update process:
racadm fwupdate -s
● Rollback to the standby firmware:
racadm fwupdate -r
● Upload firmware image from TFTP server, start firmware update. After firmware update is complete,
delete previous iDRAC configuration:
racadm fwupdate -g -u -a 192.168.0.100 -d /tmp/images --clearcfg
NOTE: Firmware update from local RACADM (using -p -u -d options) is not supported on Linux
operating system.

Description	On the PowerEdge FX2/FX2s systems, you can manage the compute sleds and CMC using
the iDRAC’s RACADM Proxy feature that redirects commands from iDRAC to CMC. You
can return the CMC response to local or remote RACADM.to access the CMC configuration and reporting
features without placing the CMC on the management network. The CMC configuration commands are
supported through local proxy when local configuration is enabled on iDRAC.
NOTE: Local racadm and local racadm proxy runs with root user privilege.
Synopsis	Local RACADM proxy usage
racadm <CMC racadm subcommand> --proxy
Remote RACADM proxy usage
racadm <CMC racadm subcommand> -u <username> -p <password> -r <idrac-ip
connected to cmc> --proxy

NOTE:
● The attribute racadm get -g cfgractuning -o cfgRacTuneChassisMgmtAtServer
must be set as non-zero in CMC.
● The attribute racadm get system.ChassisControl.ChassisManagementMonitoring
attribute must be enabled in iDRAC.
● --proxy must be entered at the end of the command.
● The root privilege is the default privilege for Local RACADM proxy.
● The user privilege in the Remote RACADM proxy for CMC maps to iDRAC privilege.

● When CMC is not placed on the network, the import, export, and file operation commands to CIFS,
NFS, or FTP will fail.
● When the Remote or Local RACADM Proxy operation is in progress, if the iDRAC is reset, then the
Proxy operation fails and the output is not displayed in Remote or Local RACADM.
● When racadm getsystem.ChassisControl.ChassisManagementMonitoring attribute is
set to monitor, all the users including root users can only view the attribute. To configure, set the
attribute to monitor and manage in CMC.
Input	● -u — Specifies the user name of the remote share that stores the catalog file.
● -p — Specifies the password of the remote share that stores the catalog file.
● -r — Specifies the iDRAC IP address connected to CMC.

systemerase :
Description	Allows you to erase the components to remove the server from use.
Synopsis	● To erase a specific component.
racadm systemerase <component>
● To erase multiple components.
racadm systemerase <component>,<component>,<component>

Input	● <component>—the valid types of components are:
○ bios—To reset the BIOS to default.
○ diag—To erase embedded diagnostics.
○ drvpack—To erase embedded OS driver pack.
○ dpu—Erase all the user configurations from the supported DPUs.
○ idrac—To reset the iDRAC to default.
○ lcdata—To erase Lifecycle Controller data.
○ allaps—To reset all apps.
○ cryptographicerasepd—To erase the physical disk. This supports SED, NVMe drives, and PCIe
cards
○ overwritepd—To overwrite physical disk. This supports SAS and SATA drives.
○ percnvcache—To erase NV cache.
○ reinstallfw— To reinstall same firmware version detected for supported devices.
○ vflash—To erase vFlash.
○ nvdimm—To erase all NonVolatileMemory.
NOTE: When BIOS is selected for System Erase, the server is turned off and the iDRAC is reset at
the end of the Automated Task Application. To complete the process of BIOS reset, the server power
must be restored. When the server is turned on, during POST, the BIOS completes the process of
resetting to the default properties. At the completion of the reset process, the server is again turned
off. Resetting the BIOS also includes the erasing of BIOS-related nonvolatile settings that are used by
the OS and embedded in the UEFI applications.
NOTE: When the racadm systemerase command is executed, the iDRAC will take the following actions
if the:
● Server is powered off—it is powered on.
● Server is powered on—a graceful system reboot will be executed.
● ACPI is enabled on the server— a graceful shutdown occurs within a minute or two.
● ACPI is not enabled—a forced shutdown occurs and it may require up to ten minutes to complete.
Following the server reboot, the Lifecycle Controller will execute the System Erase job to carry out
the requested actions. All actions performed by the System Erase operations are recorded to the
Lifecycle Log, including details of all devices erased. When these actions are completed, the server will
be powered off and remain in this state, allowing service personnel to perform any needed posterase
actions such as drive removal or hardware reconfiguration. When the server is powered on to return to
service, the Lifecycle Controller will collect the system inventory and reflect any hardware or firmware
changes made after the System Erase.
